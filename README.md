# Gemstone Price Prediction

## Goal : Predict the price of Gemstone usig Machine Learning and Deep Learning

#### This is a Regression task.

In this project I trained Neural Network and Boosting machine learning algorithms such as LightGBM and Catboost. To get the better performance I combined the predictions from all three algorithms and performed ensembling. This technique increased the accuracy of the model dramatically.

## Performed Tasks: 
 * Data analysis and preprocessing.
 * Data visualizaiton to better understand the data.
 * Feature engineering by combinng multiple features.
 * Cross Validation to better understand the models performance.

## Data Scource: 
The dataset was collected from kaggle. The details about the dataset can be found in the below link.
``` https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8 ```

### Evaluation Metric used:
   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)


### Used Algorithms
 - Neural Networks
 - LightGBM
 - CatBoost

### Problem solved
   * This solution can be used to detect the price of Gemstones by Jwellers and Jewellery companies to acurately determine the price based on the features.
